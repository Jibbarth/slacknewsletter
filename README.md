# Slack Newsletter

![CI](https://github.com/Jibbarth/slacknewsletter/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/barth/slacknewsletter)

This application allows you to generate a newsletter from your [Slack](https://slack.com) channels.
It goes through the channels looking for links, combines them into a html file, and sends it by email.
It's ideal for keeping track of your finds when the historical Slack reaches its limit.

## Installation & Configuration

1. Clone the project and launch `composer install` inside.

2. Generate a [Token on your slack workspace](https://github.com/Jibbarth/slacknewsletter/wiki/Generate-an-App-to-get-a-Token)

3. In your `.env.local`, complete your smtp configuration, the receivers, and your Slack token like that :

```
MAILER_DSN=smtp://awesome-smtp:25
RECEIVERS=me@example.net,mailing-list@example.net
SLACK_TOKEN=xoxp-XXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXX
```

4. Choose your channels to browse and add them in `config/channels.json`.
You can check out the `config/channels.json.dist` to see how add a new channels

5. (OPTIONNAL) : Pimp your newsletter by altering parameters in `config/package/parameters.yaml`

6. Configure your cron to execute command to browse, build, and send newsletter.

For example :

```bash
## Every day at 8am, browse channels and store them
0 8 * * * php bin/console app:newsletter:browse
## Every monday at 8:05 am, build the newsletter and send it
5 8 * * 1 php bin/console app:newsletter:build && php bin/console app:newsletter:send
```

## Build With

* [Symfony 5.1](http://symfony.com/)
    * symfony/console
    * symfony/mailer
    * symfony/yaml
* [FlySystem from The Php League](http://flysystem.thephpleague.com/)
* [Frlnc Php Slack](https://github.com/Frlnc/php-slack)
* [Embed](https://github.com/oscarotero/Embed)
* [Carbon](https://carbon.nesbot.com/)

Thank to theirs awesome work.

## Customize the newsletter

If you want to customize the newsletter, all templates are in `templates` folder.

Before testing rendering, you have to retrieve some messages :

```bash
php bin/console app:newsletter:browse -d 5
```
> The `-d` or `--days` is to specified how many days to retrieve.
You can have lots of data by this way.

To test the view in web-browser, launch a web server :

```bash
symfony local:server:start -d # With Symfony CLI binary
php -S localhost:8000 -t public # Using php built-in web-server
```
and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/test/mail](http://127.0.0.1:8000/test/mail)

But you probably have to send emails to test compatibility with emails viewer.

You can launch theses commands to avoid archivation of messages and builded news.

```bash
php bin/console app:newsletter:build --no-archive
php bin/console app:newsletter:send --no-archive
```
